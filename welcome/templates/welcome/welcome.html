	<p>I can't believe it's been so many years already !</p>

	<p>Oh,  I remember when you first walked in here and cleaned out my purse while I was doing the paperwork. I guess this degree deserved you eh ?</p>

	<p>You're a fully trained Financier now, you can legally hire, buy, build and sell anything you want. But you'll need money for that, won't you ?</p>

	<p>Ah, I'm just messing with you. The king's men are going to be here in a few days with your <em>complementary</em> chestful of gold. I'm told they've already assigned you to a place. It's a minuscule settlement, quite far away from here. I'm sure you'll find profitable endeavours there though, even among those peasants.</p>

	<p>Be warned, you will not be alone. Other Financiers are being sent, and they will attempt to reap the benefits of this soon-to-be growing town.</p>

	<p>Competition is bad for business, you know, so you <em>might</em> want to do something about that...</p>
